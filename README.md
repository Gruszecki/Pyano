### Play synth with the computer keyboard.

Use 0-8 or arrow keys to change sound pitch.

Click on a particular waveform to get its sound (default: sine wave).

Set sliders with attack, sustain and release and click <i>Set sound</i> to apply changes.

The maximal sound length is 10s. If selected ASR properties exceed that time, they are adjusted.
